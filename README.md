# helium.com.cy

The (un)official website to assist the Cypriot Helium community.

The idea behind https://helium.com.cy/ is to help my local community claim ownership of their devices, provide anonymous chat for owners, and most importantly, plan where you can place yours.

If you want me to already to add your forecasted location, dm (on discord) me your latlongs (use latlong.net) or wait till I add a feature to submit your forecast.

Also, if you can code, the repo is open source :wink:
