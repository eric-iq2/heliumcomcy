# helium.com.cy

The (un)official website to assist the Cypriot Helium community.

The idea behind https://helium.com.cy/ is to help my local community claim ownership of their devices, provide anonymous chat for owners, and most importantly, plan where you can place yours.

## Alpha stage

If you want me to already to add your forecasted location, dm (on discord) me your latlongs (use latlong.net) or wait till I add a feature to submit your forecast.

* See all witnesses 
* See witnesses per hotspot
* Add your hotspot
* See area elevation
* Claim dibs (since you can show a date added)

## Beta stage

Hopefully I'll get some time to do all this. Let me know stuff I should add.

* Calculate line of sight
* Provide annonymous chat between members and owners
* Send a one time email annonymously to an owner, or send a poke
* See details per hotspot
* Add/edit details per forecasted hotspot
